# Day 1: Python Fundamentals - Syntax, Variables, & Data Types

Today I officially started my Python journey! I focused on understanding the core syntax and how Python handles data without explicit declarations.

### 📚 What I Learned

1. **Python Syntax & Indentation:** Python uses whitespace (indentation) to define blocks of code, unlike other languages that use braces `{}`.
2. **Comments:** Used `#` for single-line notes and triple quotes `"""` for documentation.
3. **Variables & Case Sensitivity:** Variables are created the moment a value is assigned. `a` and `A` are two different variables.
4. **Casting:** Explicitly changing data types using `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`.
5. **String Basics:** Learned how to access characters by index and use loops to iterate through strings.

### 📝 Reflections

Python feels very close to English. I learned that statements don't need semicolons and end automatically with a new line.
